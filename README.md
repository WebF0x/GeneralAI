StrongAI
=========

Strong Artificial intelligence
------------------------------
- Powerful - Takes intelligent decisions
- Evolving - Learns and improves itself
- Versatile - Adapts to different tasks
- Intuitive - Easy to use


The plan
--------
The first approach is to make an AI that can play any type of game. 
Then, we can reformulate a real world problem as a game and use our AI to solve it. 

For example, a fully automated system to produce tomatoes: 
We can give the AI control of the amount of sunlight and water, when to harvest the tomatoes and how to plant seeds. The AI would then receive a score in function of the amout of tomatoes produced, their quality, and the garden's cost in ressource (space, time, money, pollution). 

What we have
============

Artificial Intelligences
------------------------
- [RandomAI](https://github.com/WebF0x/StrongAI/tree/master/AIs/RandomAI "Completely random!") - Takes random decisions
- [HumanAI](https://github.com/WebF0x/StrongAI/tree/master/AIs/HumanAI "Take the commands!") - You manually control the AI
- [CaseBasedAI](https://github.com/WebF0x/StrongAI/tree/master/AIs/CaseBasedAI "Use the (brute) force, Luke!") - Takes decisions based on past experiences

Worlds
------
- Game of [TicTacToe](https://github.com/WebF0x/StrongAI/tree/master/Worlds/TicTacToe "A classic!")

In General
----------
- [GeneralAI](https://github.com/WebF0x/StrongAI/tree/master/AIs/GeneralAI "Interface between Worlds and AI's") - Interface between Worlds and AI's
- [Serialization](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal "cereal, by University of South California") - Save and load

Artificial Intelligences
------------------------
- [Neural Network AI](https://github.com/WebF0x/StrongAI/tree/master/AIs/NeuralNetAI "Inspired by the brain") - Inspired by the brain
- Natural Selection AI - Breed, cull the weak, repeat
- Dispatcher - Separate tasks in subtasks

Worlds
------
- Interface with any game/software - Input(audio/video), Output(keyboard/mouse events)
- Deterministic games - Chess, Checkers, Reversi, etc
- Chance games - Poker, Blackjack, Backgammon, Minesweeper, Solitaire
- Real-time games - Starcraft, Minecraft, Diablo, Racing
- Robots - Input(sensors), Output(motors)
