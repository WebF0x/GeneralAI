StrongAI
=========

Strong Artificial intelligence
------------------------------
- Powerful - Takes intelligent decisions
- Evolving - Learns and improves itself
- Versatile - Adapts to different tasks
- Intuitive - Easy to use


The plan
--------
The first approach is to make an AI that can play any type of game. 
Then, we can reformulate a real world problem as a game and use our AI to solve it. 

For example, let's say we want to create an AI to drive a car: 
- The AI needs to control the gas and break pedals, the steering wheel, the windshield wipers, etc.
- The AI needs to know where he is, his destination, what we see around the car, what we hear, the fuel level, etc.
- We need a way to measure his performance. We could generate a score in function of the time of travel, fuel used and laws broken.
- We need a way to train the AI. Let's plug it to some driving computer simulation.
- Train it in the real world.
- You now have a car driving AI!

What we have
============

Artificial Intelligences
------------------------
- [RandomAI](https://github.com/WebF0x/StrongAI/tree/master/AIs/RandomAI "Completely random!") - Takes random decisions
- [HumanAI](https://github.com/WebF0x/StrongAI/tree/master/AIs/HumanAI "Take the commands!") - You manually control the AI
- [CaseBasedAI](https://github.com/WebF0x/StrongAI/tree/master/AIs/CaseBasedAI "Use the (brute) force, Luke!") - Takes decisions based on past experiences

Worlds
------
- Game of [TicTacToe](https://github.com/WebF0x/StrongAI/tree/master/Worlds/TicTacToe "A classic!")

In General
----------
- [GeneralAI](https://github.com/WebF0x/StrongAI/tree/master/AIs/GeneralAI "Interface between Worlds and AI's") - Interface between Worlds and AI's
- [Serialization](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal "cereal, by University of South California") - Save and load
